# seaBattle
This code defines a simple Sea Battle game where the player tries to sink all of the computer's ships by guessing their locations on a 10x10 grid. The game is initialized by setting up the ships and randomly placing them on the board. Then, the player takes turns entering row and column coordinates, and the computer reports whether the guess was a hit or a miss. The game ends when the player has sunk all of the ships (17 hits are needed, since the ships have lengths of 2, 3, 3, 4, and 5).
